# Python Basic: Exercise-33 with Solution
# Write a Python program to sum of three given integers. However, if two values are equal sum will be zero.

def sum(x,y,z):
    if x == y or y == z or z == x:
        sum = 0
    else:
        sum = x + y + z
    return sum

n1=int(input("Enter your first number:\n"))
n2=int(input("Enter your Second number:\n"))
n3=int(input("Enter your Third number:\n"))

print(f"sum of {n1} and {n2} and {n3} is :\n")
print(sum(n1,n2,n3))
